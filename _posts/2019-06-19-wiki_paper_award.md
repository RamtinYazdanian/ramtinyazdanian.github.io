title: Best paper award at ICWSM!

Our paper on Wikipedia, titled "Eliciting New Wikipedia Users' Interests via Automatically Mined Questionnaires: For a Warm Welcome, Not a Cold Start", published in ICWSM 2019, received an "Outstanding Problem-Solution Paper" award. The paper proposes a language-independent method for the generation of questionnaires that allow for the eliciation of early user profiles for newcomers to Wikipedia. These profiles enable Wikipedia to provide article or collaborator recommendations to the user to get them started with contributing to Wikipedia.
